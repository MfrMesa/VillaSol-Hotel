# VillaSol-Hotel

We developed a website from scratch, starting with the Home design in Figma (on my part) and then transforming those designs into functional components using React with Vite. I made sure every element was consistent with our vision, implementing responsive CSS and Sass styling for an optimal user experience.

My role covered the development and design of several key components, including the footer, banner, navbar, home card, the implementation of language change functionality as well as the 404 and restaurant pages along with their respective components. In addition, I was in charge of giving it the final design touches.

We use tools like Miró, Figma, Trello and Github to stay organized and collaborate efficiently. This combination of tools allowed us to meet our one-month delivery deadline, while maintaining a high level of quality in project development and design.
